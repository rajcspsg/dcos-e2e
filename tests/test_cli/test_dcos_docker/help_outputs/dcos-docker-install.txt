Usage: minidcos docker install [OPTIONS] INSTALLER

  Install DC/OS on the given Docker cluster.

Options:
  --genconf-dir DIRECTORY         Path to a directory that contains additional
                                  files for the DC/OS installer. All files from
                                  this directory will be copied to the "genconf"
                                  directory before running the DC/OS installer.
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT           The ID of the cluster to use.  [default:
                                  default]
  --extra-config FILE             The path to a file including DC/OS
                                  configuration YAML. The contents of this file
                                  will be added to add to a default
                                  configuration.
  --security-mode [disabled|permissive|strict]
                                  The security mode to use for a DC/OS
                                  Enterprise cluster. This overrides any
                                  security mode set in ``--extra-config``.
  --license-key FILE              This is ignored if using open source DC/OS. If
                                  using DC/OS Enterprise, this defaults to the
                                  value of the `DCOS_LICENSE_KEY_PATH`
                                  environment variable.
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]   The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                  the SSH transport requires IP routing to be
                                  set up. See "minidcos docker setup-mac-
                                  network". It also requires the "ssh" command
                                  to be available. This can be provided by
                                  setting the `MINIDCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT`
                                  environment variable. When using a TTY,
                                  different transports may use different line
                                  endings.  [default: docker-exec]
  --variant [auto|oss|enterprise]
                                  Choose the DC/OS variant. If the variant does
                                  not match the variant of the given installer,
                                  an error will occur. Using "auto" finds the
                                  variant from the installer. Finding the
                                  variant from the installer takes some time and
                                  so using another option is a performance
                                  optimization.
  -v, --verbose                   Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                  times for more verbose output.
  --wait-for-dcos                 Wait for DC/OS after creating the cluster.
                                  This is equivalent to using "minidcos docker
                                  wait" after this command. "minidcos docker
                                  wait" has various options available and so may
                                  be more appropriate for your use case. If the
                                  chosen transport is "docker-exec", this will
                                  skip HTTP checks and so the cluster may not be
                                  fully ready.
  --workspace-dir DIRECTORY       Creating a cluster can use approximately 2 GB
                                  of temporary storage. Set this option to use a
                                  custom "workspace" for this temporary storage.
                                  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile
                                  .html#tempfile.gettempdir for details on the
                                  temporary directory location if this option is
                                  not set.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
