Usage: minidcos docker destroy-list [OPTIONS] [CLUSTER_IDS]...

  Destroy clusters.

  To destroy all clusters, run ``minidcos docker destroy $(minidcos docker
  list)``.

Options:
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]  The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                 the SSH transport requires IP routing to be set
                                 up. See "minidcos docker setup-mac-network". It
                                 also requires the "ssh" command to be
                                 available. This can be provided by setting the
                                 `MINIDCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT` environment
                                 variable. When using a TTY, different
                                 transports may use different line endings.
                                 [default: docker-exec]
  -h, --help                     Show this message and exit.
