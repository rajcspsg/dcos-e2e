Vertigo is a Python wrapper around the VBoxManage command-line tool for managing
VirtualBox virtual machines. VBoxManage is an excellent and fully-featured tool
for managing virtual machines. Vertigo wraps it in a thin layer of Python code
and presents a Pythonic, object-oriented API.

Vertigo provides the following advantages over directly using the VBoxManage
tool:

  - Vertigo collects and manages all the state (such as virtual machine
  identifiers) that normally need to be passed explicitly to VBoxManage.

  - It allows your Python program to interact with a clean Python API instead of
  dealing with the command line.

Vertigo does not interact with the Guest operating system at all. Thus Vertigo
is not meant to be a VM provisioning or deployment tool. Vagrant is a much
better tool for those purposes. Vertigo is best used when you already have your
VMs created and set up but need to programmatically start, shutdown or configure
them with the full flexibility of VBoxManage.
